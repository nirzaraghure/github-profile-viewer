  "explanation": `
I analyzed the CSS code for the nirzaraghure/github-profile-viewer repository and found the following issues and areas for improvement:

1. **Missing transition effect**: The button styles are missing a transition effect for the background color. This can make the button animations look abrupt and unprofessional. I added a basic transition effect to fix this.
2. **Code consistency**: The code is generally well-structured, but I noticed that the button styles are missing a semicolon at the end of the line. I added the semicolon to maintain code consistency.
3. **Minor improvements**: I made minor improvements to the code formatting to make it more readable and consistent.

The updated code fixes the issues and provides a more polished and professional CSS style sheet for the nirzaraghure/github-profile-viewer repository.
