# System Architecture

```mermaid
**High-Level System Overview**

The repository appears to be a simple web application built with a client-side JavaScript framework, utilizing a static website generator. The application is likely deployed on a containerized platform, leveraging Docker, and automated through a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline managed by Jenkins.

**Module/Component Breakdown**

1. **Frontend**:
	* `index.html`: The main entry point of the web application.
	* `script.js`: Client-side JavaScript code responsible for dynamic behavior.
	* `style.css`: Stylesheet for visual presentation.
2. **Build and Deployment**:
	* `Dockerfile`: Specifies the base image and instructions for building a Docker container.
	* `Jenkinsfile`: Defines the CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.

**Data Flow Description**

The data flow is relatively straightforward:

1. The user interacts with the web application through `index.html`.
2. Client-side JavaScript code in `script.js` handles user input and updates the UI.
3. The application's static assets (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) are served directly from the container.

**Technology Stack Reasoning**

The technology stack is chosen for its simplicity and ease of use:

* **Frontend**: Client-side JavaScript with a static website generator ( implicit ) 
* **Build and Deployment**: Docker for containerization and Jenkins for CI/CD pipeline management.

**Folder Responsibility Explanation**

The repository is structured to separate concerns:

* **Frontend** (src): Contains client-side code and static assets.
* **Build and Deployment**: Contains Docker and Jenkins configuration files.
